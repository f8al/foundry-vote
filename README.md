# foundry-vote
a module for FoundryVTT to add a /vote command to chat


How to use it at the table

Once enabled in your world:
	•	Simple yes/no poll:
/vote should we rest here or press on
→ will actually detect two options:
	•	should we rest here
	•	press on
	•	Explicit multi-option poll:
/vote check door for traps or just open it or ignore it
	•	Single-question yes/no:
/vote check the door for traps first
→ creates a Yes/No poll.
